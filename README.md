## Because PC viruses may use simular code to infect computers this might get reconized as a virus. BUT Abyss does not contain any viruses!

# Abyss Client for Vanilla, Forge, Lunar, Badlion
This repo is used to proof that i dont rat anyone.
You dont need the Injector cause its bad, just inject with Fate or idk.
Please star this. üôè

## About the loader
Download the release/tag Loader, this loader will auto download the latest github released Abyss dll into the following path:
# IF it sais "Error: Could not create remote thread!" then try: `Abyss Injector v1.5`
```java
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\libraries\Abyss.dll.
```
If the loader is tweaking then feel free to install the latest Abyss.dll and drag it into the path above this text

## About me ratting (fake news)
Smellon just said that i should use his launcher, and it also made sense for me
Canse he said then noone can crack it easily and get the dll
And he wanted it to be like this
Because smellon doesnt want his code to be open source
He also said he doesnt want other pples to rat the dll and put it again on youtube
Which also made sense to me. So he asked to use his launcher and so i did
When you would check the source of abyss u can see theres no rat
But like i said smellon doesnt want it to be open source
Btw the old injector code is public because smellon cracked it in under 2 minutes
So please understand that if the injecotr is really ratted its not my fault because its not mine
For le i litterly did nothing wrong and then ill just get reported to github for no reason
This is so time wasting and annoying ill just fuck about smellon and just make abyss like i wanted open source
But now ill just do it anyways ill just remove securitty checks from the .dll and then hopefully everything is fine
